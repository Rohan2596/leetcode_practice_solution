/**
 * Problem Statement
 * Given an integer x, return true if x is palindrome integer.
 * <p>
 * An integer is a palindrome when it reads the same backward as forward.
 * <p>
 * For example, 121 is a palindrome while 123 is not.
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * Example 1:
 * <p>
 * Input: x = 121
 * Output: true
 * Explanation: 121 reads as 121 from left to right and from right to left.
 * Example 2:
 * <p>
 * Input: x = -121
 * Output: false
 * Explanation: From left to right, it reads -121. From right to left, it becomes 121-. Therefore it is not a palindrome.
 * Example 3:
 * <p>
 * Input: x = 10
 * Output: false
 * Explanation: Reads 01 from right to left. Therefore it is not a palindrome.
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * Constraints:
 * <p>
 * -231 <= x <= 231 - 1
